# SMS system design
Design a system to send SMS to the users from a system. Like how promotional SMSs are sent from the company to the end users.

## Use cases 
1. The user should be able to enter the end user single or bulk entry list.
2. The user should be able to send the SMS to be sent to users.
3. The system should work on a high throughput.
4. The system should be scalable and should be able to take bust load traffic.
